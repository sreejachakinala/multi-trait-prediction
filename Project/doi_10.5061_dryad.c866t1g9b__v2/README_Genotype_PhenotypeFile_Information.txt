DATA & FILE OVERVIEW

File List: Phenotypic_Data, have the phenotypic values (BLUPs) of 280 genotypes for grain weight per spike (GWPS), plant height (PH), grain yield (GY) from five different locations, days to heading (DH), grain filling duration (GFD) from four different locations, grain number per spike (GNPS) from two different locations within India along with pooled BLUPs across locations, Genotypic_Data, contains processed SNP genotypic information obtained through Axiom Wheat Breeder’s Genotyping Array (Aﬀymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, United States).

METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: The GWAS panel of 280 genotypes were evaluated for GWPS (gram), PH (cm), GY (gram) from five different locations, DH (days), GFD (days) from four different locations, GNPS (number) from two different locations. The genotypes were genotyped using Axiom Wheat Breeder’s Genotyping Array (Aﬀymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, United States) having 35,143 genome-wide SNPs.

Methods for processing the data: The GWAS panel of 280 genotypes were genotyped using Axiom Wheat Breeder’s Genotyping Array (Aﬀymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, United States) having 35,143 genome-wide SNPs. The monomorphic, markers with minor allele frequency (MAF) of <5%, missing data of >20%, and heterozygote frequency >25% were removed from the analysis. The remaining set of 14,790 high-quality SNPs was used in GWAS analysis.

Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the data: R package ‘augmentedRCBD’, Trait Analysis by aSSociation Evolution and Linkage (TASSEL) version 5.0, STRUCURE, STRUCTURE HARVESTER, BLINK (Bayesian-information and Linkage-disequilibrium Iteratively Nested Keyway) model, Genome Association and Prediction Integrated Tool (GAPIT) version 3.0 in R software package.

Standards and calibration information, if appropriate: Nil

Environmental/experimental conditions: Well irrigated and optimal condition with standard package of practices.

Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data: Nil
